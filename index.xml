      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Vathsa, a professional Robotics Engineer and amateur everything else. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music and Literature, and I wish I did a lot more. I needed a place to express my joyful inner self, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m being ironic about that. I genuinely believe writing will motivate me to dig deeper into the things I like a lot more than I usually do and hopefully, a little more than what would be healthy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out Forestry, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually use Vim to write my posts like some basement dweller. So far, it seems straightforward but annoying to use if I want to do anything more than the bare minimum. In this case that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Anything that makes me write more and fuck around less.</description>
