      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Vathsa, a professional Robotics Engineer and amateur everything else. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music and Literature, and I wish I did a lot more. I needed a place to express my joyful inner self, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m being ironic about that. I genuinely believe writing will motivate me to dig deeper into the things I like a lot more than I usually do and hopefully, a little more than what would be healthy.</description>

      <description>I finally got a work laptop. Finally. It was worth the wait though, I now have a shiny new laptop with a glowing RGB star on the lid.
I was fantasizing about this for weeks. Just me and my laptop, all alone in my house. Ugh, I get so romantic sometimes. Just imagine all the projects I can do! All the shitty memes I can make on Photoshop! All the brilliantly written, beautifully designed, post-modern indie video games that I can play!</description>
