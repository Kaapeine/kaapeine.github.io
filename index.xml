      <description>I found forestry so confusing to use. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those blocky websites that trades usability for &amp;ldquo;accessible&amp;rdquo; user experience. A trend I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a lot of modern websites. Hard pass. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to text editors and bash scripts for now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Vathsa, a professional Robotics Engineer and amateur everything else. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music and Literature, and I wish I did a lot more. I needed a place to express my joyful inner self, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m being ironic about that. I genuinely believe writing will motivate me to dig deeper into the things I like a lot more than I usually do and hopefully, a little more than what would be healthy.</description>

      <description>I finally got a work laptop. Finally. It was worth the wait though, I now have a shiny new laptop with a glowing RGB star on the lid.
I was looking forward to this for weeks. Just me and my laptop, all alone in my house. Just imagine all the projects I can do! All the shitty memes I can make on Photoshop! All the brilliantly written, beautifully designed, post-modern indie video games that I can play!</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve set up Forestry</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out Forestry, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually use Vim to write my posts like some basement dweller. So far, it seems straightforward but annoying to use if I want to do anything more than the bare minimum. In this case that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Anything that makes me write more and fuck around less.</description>
