      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out Forestry, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually use Vim to write my posts like some basement dweller. So far, it seems straightforward but annoying to use if I want to do anything more than the bare minimum. In this case that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Anything that makes me write more and fuck around less.</description>
