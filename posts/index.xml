      <description>I found forestry so confusing to use. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those blocky websites that trade usability in the name of &amp;ldquo;accessible&amp;rdquo; user experience. A trend I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a lot of modern websites. Hard pass. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to Vim and bash scripts for now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out Forestry, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually use Vim to write my posts like some basement dweller. So far, it seems straightforward but annoying to use if I want to do anything more than the bare minimum. In this case that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Anything that makes me write more and fuck around less.</description>
